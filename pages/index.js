              Hey! My name is Daria and I was born in Russia. My city is located just north of the Arctic Circle.
              <br />
              Ever since I was a little girl, I had an active mind and optimistic outlook of life. I always found myself
              seeing the possibilities everywhere.
              <br />
              <br />
              At age 13, I was already dreaming of how I could have a life of adventure. I was daydreaming about moving
              to a big city, more specifically, a city on the west coast of the United States.
              <br />
              When I was 22 years old, after completing my bachelor's and master's degree in Cross-cultural Communications
              and International Relations at Belgorod State University, I decided to step forward and pursue my dreams.
              I bought a one-way ticket to the beautiful city I always dreamed of seeing.
              <br />
              <br />
              Now, forwarding a few years later, I've found my passion in Software Engineering, because, I've always
              been obsessed with creating things, and even more obsessed with making things better. I aspire toward a
              career that will allow me to channel my creativity through crafting beautiful software and engaging
              user-experiences while living next to the beach. üèñÔ∏è

              .......
              <br />
              When I'm not on the computer, I'm probably hanging out with my husband, enjoy knitting,
              working out in the park and petting my cat.
